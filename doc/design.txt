Design, Problems, Avoidances:

About:

This is my personal systems library for windows. It abstracts the win32 api and organizes it to my liking. 
It's a personal project that I use both in buisness, life and education. I do try and employ best programming practices as I learn them.

Problems winapi should solve:

- abstract the win32 api and make using it easier. 
- easily create a window and start doing stuff. 
- to help faciliate the visual demonstration of science and programming.

Problems winapi has no buisness with:

- customizable windows. The purpose of winapi is to keep things simple and easy. If I want
heavy customizing, I need to just use the raw win32 api. less is more.

- styling. this api should be about getting a window out quick and doing GDI/3d api;
this isn't a CSS replacement. If I want style, I need to get be getting paid. winapi is to help
me demostrate computer science, not sell widgets on the world wide web.
