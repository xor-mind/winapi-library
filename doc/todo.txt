1 - major refactor happening now. 
I forget how the API works. By commenting most features and steadily unrolling the comments, I'll 
get the gist of the library. 

I'll use BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(RefactorTest) as a function to test the refactor. Hopefully this will go
quick.


1.1 Get rid of the macros. 

Begin at windows.h and from the top of the file, comment out one macro at a time. After the program breaks.
Fix it. after enough work, push; repeat. 

1.2 delete refactored code that has been commented

1.3 maybe start documenting a bit of the code

1) test child like behavior. the expunge function is confusing as fuck.
